    The default representation is intentionally the legacy one: every entry in
    ``tensors`` is one logical row and no deduplication metadata is allocated.
    ``enable_deduplication`` adds stable provenance to the physical segments.
    Operations that combine or slice dedup-enabled values then use a CSR-like
    logical-row mapping:

    - ``_row_offsets`` partitions the flattened logical segment references.
    - ``_segment_indices`` maps each logical segment reference to ``tensors``.
    - ``_segment_provenance`` is stable across deepcopy/pickle and is the only
      evidence used to re-intern physical segments.

    Prompt identity is deliberately absent: belonging to the same prompt group
    makes media a candidate for sharing, but never proves media equality.

    Worked example. Prompt A has one image and prompt B has two, each already
    merged by :meth:`merge_segments` into a single logical row::

        A: tensors = [tA]        _row_offsets = [0, 1]  _segment_indices = [0]
        B: tensors = [tB0, tB1]  _row_offsets = [0, 2]  _segment_indices = [0, 1]

    GRPO then expands each prompt into G generations. The rows are deep-copied
    while ``_prepare_multimodal_sharing`` aliases the media leaves, so
    :meth:`concat` re-interns them by provenance. For G=3::

        tensors          = [tA, tB0, tB1]            # 3 physical segments
        _row_offsets     = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]     # 6 logical rows

        len()            = 6

    Six logical rows over nine segment references and three physical tensors,
    so physical memory is flat in G. Row 4 reads as
    ``_segment_indices[_row_offsets[4]:_row_offsets[5]] == [1, 2]``, i.e. both
    of prompt B's images, without copying either.
