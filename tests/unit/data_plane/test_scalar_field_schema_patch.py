"""The dense 1-D sample shape TQ reports must match the rows it stores.

Upstream ``extract_field_schema`` rebinds a *local* for 1-D inputs
(``value = value.unsqueeze(-1)``) and derives the sample shape from it,
while ``_generate_values`` iterates the *original* ``(N,)`` tensor into
``N`` 0-d rows. Schema says ``(1,)``, storage holds ``()``.

Only the KV path notices, because it is the only one that reconstructs
from the schema: ``BatchMeta.get_shapes`` repeats the uniform ``shape``
per sample and the mooncake client reshapes raw bytes with it. That turns
a scalar column into ``(1,)`` rows, which then re-nest instead of taking
``_merge_tensors_to_tensordict``'s ``all(dim() == 0) -> torch.stack``
branch. ``SimpleStorage`` fetches stored objects by ``(index, field)`` and
never consults the schema, so it is unaffected.

These tests pin the invariant on TQ's own function rather than on a
recorded shape, so they fail if a future TQ revision changes the
derivation in either direction — the fix landing upstream shows up here as
a still-passing test, and a different 1-D convention shows up as a failure
rather than as silent nested scalars in production.
